HW #3 Notes

C Program Implementing a File Storage Server
-Multithreaded Server, using pthreads library
-clients connect via TCP sockets
-each incoming connection to a dedicated thread
	*either create threads on demand or manage a pool of available threads
-support clients in any language

Clarifications
-must be sychronized, at a minimum file-level sychronization
	*any number of threads reading the same file (via READ command) at the same time
	*first thread creates file (via ADD command), others give "ERROR: FILE EXISTS\n"
	*when file is created (via ADD command), no other threads can access it
	*during APPEND command, no other threads may be reading from file
	*during APPEND command, no other threads can be appending to file
	*A thread may execute the LIST command at any time (no sychronization)
	*DELETE only when no other thread is accessing the file (all active reads and writes must complete first)
	*Starvation must be avoided
